/**
 * You may re-order items here for your own menu.  Any items not explicitly 
 * sorted will be sorted by their final translated phrases for each given client.
 *
 * To change order of the upgrades in the menus, you'll have to prefix the short name of the upgrade:
 * RPGUpgradesMenu: rpgupgrade_xxx
 * RPGSellMenu: rpgsell_xxx
 * RPGUpgradeSettingsMenu: rpgupgrsettings_xxx
 * RPGHelpMenu: rpghelp_xxx
 *
 * You can find the short name of upgrades in parentheses behind the readable name
 * in the smrpg_listupgrades command output or from the name of the generated config file:
 * [mod]/cfg/sourcemod/smrpg/smrpg_upgrade_xxx.cfg where xxx is the short name.
