// This defines a list of weapons which's experience rates differ from the default setting.
// You can give more experience for a kill with a difficult weapon to reward players using it.

// Put the weapon classname as the section key (you might omit "weapon_")
// There are a few options:
//   - "exp_kill": The experience for a kill multiplied by the victim's level.
//   - "exp_damage": The experience for hurting an enemy multiplied by the damage done.
//   - "exp_bonus": Extra constant experience to give on top of the regular experience on a kill.
//
// You don't have to specify each option for each weapon.
// It defaults back to the global settings of the smrpg_exp_damage, smrpg_exp_kill and smrpg_exp_kill_bonus convars.
// E.g.
// 
// "weapon_knife"
// {
// 	"exp_damage" "8.0"
// 	"exp_kill" "15.0"
// 	"exp_bonus" "10"
// }
