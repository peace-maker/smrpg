// SM:RPG Impulse Upgrade Config
//
// This config can be used to change the speed increase and effect duration per weapon.
// If a weapon isn't listed here or has one of the options missing, 
// the plugin uses the default values from the 
// convars smrpg_impulse_speed_inc and smrpg_impulse_duration.
//
// All weapons use the default settings set by the above convars by default.
// If you want to exclude a weapon from this upgrade, 
// just set "speed_increase" to "0" for that weapon.
//
// Use the weapon's entity name as the section name.
// There are two options to set for each weapon:
// - "speed_increase"     : Speed increase in percent when player is damaged (multiplied by upgrade level).
//                          When set to e.g. "0.2", the victim will get 20% faster when shot with that weapon.
// - "duration"           : Duration of Impulse's effect in seconds.
//                          When this is set to e.g. "0.8", the victim will get the speed boost for 0.8 seconds.
//                          This stays the same for all upgrade levels.
//
// Here's an example section:
// "weapon_m4a1"
// {
//     "speed_increase" "0.3"
//     "duration" "0.6"
// }
"ImpulseWeapons"
{
//	"weapon_deagle"
//	{
//		"speed_increase" "0.2"
//		"duration" "0.8"
//	}
}
