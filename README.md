=====

Based on [CSS:RPG](http://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=51039) v1.0.5 by SeLfkiLL.

# Introduction
SM:RPG is a generic RPG (Role Playing Game) plugin. Players earn experience by killing other players or on other game dependent events. After they reach a certain amount of experience, they level up and get some credits.
The credits can be used to buy upgrades which give the player an advantage against his enemies.

This plugin tries to be as game independent as possible. If some upgrade or core feature isn't working in your game, leave a comment.
There's a seperate plugin for Counter-Strike: Source/Global Offensive to give proper experience on game events like bomb exploded or hostage rescued.

# Modular upgrades
All upgrades are standalone plugins that register with the core. The core smrpg plugin handles the levels, experience and credits of a player as well as the upgrade levels.
When an upgrade registers itself at the core, it'll automatically be added to the rpgmenu for players to buy.

Server admins can install a new upgrade simply by loading the upgrade plugin.

Developers can easily add new upgrades using the extensive API provided by the core.
Have a look at the [include files](https://github.com/peace-maker/smrpg/blob/master/scripting/include)!
